- 👋 Hi, I am Michael McNeil, a software engineering consultant in Scotland.
- 👀 I am a full-stack developer who specialises in writing high-performing and scalable applications using .NET Core (and I 💖 using Microsoft Orleans for this!).  I have a keen interest in DevOps and automating as much of the software delivery lifecycle as possible.
- 🌱 I also write a lot of React and recently I've been working in Angular.
- 🌍 You can browse my blog at https://www.michaelmcneil.net/ and contact me from there.
